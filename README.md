My favorite series:
# The Boys

**The Boys** is a dark, satirical superhero television series based on the comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson.

## Why It's My Favorite:
- **Bold and Gritty:** The series exposes the darker side of superheroes.
- *Complex Characters:* Each character has a morally grey backstory.
- 🚀 Intense Action Scenes: Explosions, fights, and more!

### Memorable Characters
1. **Homelander**: The most terrifying "hero."
2. **Billy Butcher**: Gritty, determined, and sarcastic.
3. **Hughie Campbell**: The everyman who gets pulled into chaos.
